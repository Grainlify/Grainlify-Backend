# Checks that report success without checking anything

Every entry here is a real case from this repository where a verification step
ran, printed a clean result, and established nothing. They share one shape: the
check measured a **proxy** for the thing it was supposed to measure, and the
proxy was empty, absent, or mismatched for a reason unrelated to correctness.

An error is loud. An empty result looks like a pass. That is what makes these
expensive: the check does not fail, it *agrees with you*.

## 1. Shell flags that silently return nothing

### `grep -l -n`

```sh
git grep -l -n "SomePattern" -- '*.go'     # prints nothing, exit 1
```

`-l` (list matching files) and `-n` (show line numbers) are mutually
exclusive. Rather than erroring, grep returns no output. This was read as "the
pattern does not appear anywhere", and produced a confident, wrong claim that
CORS configuration was missing.

### A glob the shell expands before grep sees it

```sh
grep -rn "installation_repositories" internal/ --include=*.go   # zsh: no matches found
```

In zsh, `--include=*.go` is expanded by the **shell**, not passed through. With
no file named `--include=*.go` in the working directory, zsh aborts the command
with `no matches found` before grep runs at all. The surrounding `|| echo "NOT
handled anywhere"` then printed a definitive-sounding conclusion about code
that does exist — `installation_repositories` is handled, in
`internal/ingest/github_webhook.go`.

Quote the flag (`--include='*.go'`), or use `git grep`, which takes pathspecs
directly:

```sh
git grep -n "installation_repositories" -- '*.go'
```

**The general rule:** a search that returns nothing has two explanations —
the thing is absent, or the search did not run. Distinguish them before
concluding, with a control that must match:

```sh
git grep -n "func " -- '*.go' | head -1    # if this is empty, the search is broken
```

## 2. A regex guard that matched one gate of three

`internal/ranking/fork_guard_test.go` asserts that every verified-project gate
also excludes forks. Its first version used:

```go
regexp.MustCompile(`(?m)^\s*(?:AND\s+)?(p2?)\.status = 'verified'`)
```

Two of the three gates are introduced by `WHERE`, not `AND`, so the pattern
matched exactly one — and that one happened to be correct. The test passed
while the exclusion was missing from the other two. It was caught only because
a mutation deliberately removed the exclusion from the org board and **nothing
failed**.

The fix was to accept both introducers *and* to assert the number of gates
found:

```go
const wantGates = 3
if len(matches) != wantGates { t.Fatalf(...) }
```

**The general rule:** a structural check must assert **how much** it checked,
not only that what it checked was fine. Otherwise a restructure quietly reduces
its coverage to zero and it keeps passing.

## 3. A test that evaluated its own constant

`TestSupportDelivered_SQLAndGoAgree` compared a Go predicate against itself
rather than against the migration it was supposed to match. Breaking the SQL in
the migration did not fail it. The replacement reads the migration file from
disk.

## 4. A mutation that never compiled

While mutation-testing the support sink, two patches removed code that left a
variable unused. The build failed, the test command returned non-zero, and the
harness recorded "caught". A build failure proves nothing about a test.

The harness now asserts each patch **applied** (the pattern matched exactly
once) **and compiled** before trusting the result. Note that `go vet` is the
wrong gate for this: it rejects unreachable code, so a valid mutation reads as
a compile failure. Use `go build`.

## 5. e2e checks on pages that never rendered

`e2e/widget-overlap.spec.ts` (frontend) reported 26 of 26 passing while 25 of
those pages had white-screened, because a route mock answered with the wrong
shape and React unmounted the tree. A page with no elements cannot overlap
anything.

It now asserts a minimum interactive-element count per page before checking for
collisions.

**The general rule for all of the above:** when a check passes, ask what it
would take for it to fail. If you cannot answer, break the thing on purpose and
confirm it goes red.
